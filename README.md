# EPUB Compressor

This is a simple application I wrote to compress EPUB files to share larger ebooks over mail to my Kindle.

## Installation

This app is made in and only for Windows.

1. Download the EPUB Compressor executable (`epub-compressor.exe`) from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/releases).
2. Place the `epub-compressor.exe` file in a folder of your choice.
3. That's it! It needs to be run directly every time you need to use it, no installation required.

## Running the Application

   - **Select Folder**: The folder containing the EPUB files you want to compress.
   - **Compression Percentage**: The desired level of compression as a percentage.
3. Click the "Compress" button to start the compression process.
4. The compressed files will be stored in the same directory as specified in **Select Folder**.
